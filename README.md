AutoBid is a **peer-to-peer online car bidding platform** that connects verified sellers and buyers in a secure, transparent, and user-friendly marketplace. It is developed as a **Software Engineering Capstone Thesis Project**, applying end-to-end **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** practices.

Unlike traditional car auctions or scattered classifieds, AutoBid ensures trust through **KYC verification, escrow payments, refundable deposits, and anti-sniping mechanisms** — making car transactions faster, safer, and fairer.
